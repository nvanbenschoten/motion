			Motion
======

An Android library allowing images to exhibit a parallax effect. By replacing static pictures
and backgrounds with a fluid images that reacts to screen tilt and orientation, Android
applications can add a perceived depth, layering, and context to their content. Motion works
great for both full screen background images and smaller sized pictures to give users a whole new
perspective on how they interact with their phone. This project was inspired in part by
iOS 7's new parallax effect.

Demo
----

Feel free to download the [demo][1] to try out motion.

Setup
-----
* In Eclipse, just import the library as an Android library project.
* Project > Clean to generate the binaries you need, like R.java, etc.
* Then, just add Motion as a dependency to your existing project and you're good to go!

**Or**:

* [Download the .jar file][2]
* Add the .jar files to your project's `libs` folder, or add them as external jars to your project's
build path.

**Or**:

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}

	dependencies{
		compile 'com.nvanbenschoten.motion:library:1.0.2'
	}

**Or**:

Add the following to your `pom.xml`:

	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.nvanbenschoten.motion</groupId>
		<artifactId>library</artifactId>
		<version>1.0.2</version>
		<type>aar</type>
	</dependency>

Usage
-----

To use Motion, simply replace any existing ImageView's with a ParallaxImageView.

Once a reference to this view is acquired, register a SensorManager with the
ParallaxImageView using the `registerSensorManager()` call. This registration
is most commonly done in the `onResume` method of an `Activity/Fragment`, but can be
completed whenever the parallax effect is desired to begin.

When the parallax effect is not longer needed, it is essential to unregister the SensorManager
by calling `unregisterSensorManager()` on the ParallaxImageView so that the system sensors can
be disabled. This call is usually completed in the `onPause` method.

As an example

```java
// Obtain a reference to the object
ParallaxImageView mBackground = findViewById(R.id.background);

// Register a SensorManager to begin effect
mBackground.registerSensorManager();

...

// Unregister SensorManager when exiting
mBackground.unregisterSensorManager();
```

Configurations
--------------

There are four attributes that can be changed to adjust the parallax effect of the ImageView.
Each can be accessed either through XML attributes or through Java functions.

* parallaxIntensity (float) - adjusts the strength of the parallax effect, giving control over the
perceived depth of the view.

* tiltSensitivity (float) - adjusts the sensitivity of the view towards tilting, changing how quickly
the parallax's bounds are reached.

* forwardTiltOffset (float) - adjusts the tilt offset used to counteract a natural forward tilt of
a phone while facing a user.

* scaledIntensity (boolean) - adjusts whether the ImageView's x and y axis' parallax intensities
are scaled to the image's aspect ratio or equal to each other and to the smaller of the axis'
intensities (false by default).
